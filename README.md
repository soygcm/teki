# Teki 滴
Teki is a one meeting methodology for projects creation.
Teki means drop (of water) in Japanese. The main idea is doing small progress day by day in the process of building your project.

**This methodology is ideal for:**

* Small teams without full time to dedicate.
* Track the progress so that prevent to lose the north
* Share the past decisions to new members or stakeholders
* Projects that depends on people feedback (video games, social movements, events, etc)
* Projects that wants or need fast learning and progress

## Stages
One important thing before start every Teki is being aware of what is the stage of your project:

### Ideation
**Goals**
* Discovering initial necesities, ideas, concepts
* Create your first Pitch Deck

**Your are here if**
You do not have nothing

**You are not here when**
* You have the initial idea of what you want to build.
* You already have a Pitch Deck

**How much time you should be here**
Not to much preferable, couple of weeks or couple of months, depends in what you want to build. Keep in mind this stage is just an initial step to put together in a document what you are doing.

### Starting 
AKA: Minimum valuable product

/ Discovering what is about your project startup

### Tuning
AKA: Product Market fit

/ Discovering if there is a match between the market and your product (startup)

### Growing
* ... (I don't have any experience with this part)

In every stage you have to undersand that your goal is different so don't waste your time to get hundreds of clients if you not even know what’s your product, what's your market and what you want.

## Teki meeting

### Before start

Every member of the team has to be prepared for the meeting

1. You are not an expert (If you were you don't need Teki and probably you have your project completed or your startup is already successful), so don't assume nothing
2. Prepare the data for the meeting. What data? any kind of data: interviews, analytics, meetings, comments, etc, better if comes from your customer/client. Don't you have clientes? See next point.
3. Client: you, your friends, your colleagues, your family, people in forums, etc.
4. Use a monthly or single document (Confluence, Wiki, source code, word, google docs) to track the progress.
